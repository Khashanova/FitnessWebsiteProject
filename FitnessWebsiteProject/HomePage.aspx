It will give structure to your training and will also provide you with an idea of the load and how well you can handle it. There are no official rest days in our programs but they are all very carefully balanced so you recover on the go, some days are a lot easier than others and the other way around. For daily training programs are easier than most of our individual workouts which are slightly more intense due to their standalone nature

            Weight loss is an issue that almost everyone considers at one point or another in their lives. Whether it’s short-term weight loss goals (gaining weight over the festive season) or more serious weight problems (obesity), people will always use gyms to lose weight.

            This market segment is one of the biggest in the fitness industry. As a gym owner, you must have considerate marketing campaigns that are inviting for those who want to lose weight. It is also important to provide a variety of classes that are designed specifically for those who have weight loss goals.
